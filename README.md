What the app can do:

- On component load: render the models from the API
- Render the forms when a button is clicked (unfortunately you have to reset first, haven't figured out how to fix that)
- Store is hooked up
- If there is initial state, it can render those objects (currently no data)

What the app can't do:

- _NEXT STEP_ POST doesn't work for the store, let alone a post request to the server with a database
- Once above step is all figured out, the other crud operations should come easy
- If my understanding of the project is correct, all I would have to do to save to a mongoDB server, superagent requests with the formData as the body
